    <h1>Creating multi-column layouts using CSS floats.</h1>

    <main>
        <h3>Defining containers and creating columns</h3>
        <p>
            First- as you surely remember - you need a container that will hold your columns. This container is the
            parent element to the child elements that will serve as your columns:
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the container, you add your columns. These are typically <mark>div</mark> elements that you'll float
            to align side by side.
        </p>

        <h3>Applying floats to the columns.</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <!-- Columns will go here. -->
            <div class="column equal">column 1</div>
            <div class="column equal">column 2</div>
            <div class="column equal">column 3</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Within our code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the <mark>float:left</mark> rule ensures each column aligns to the left side of the container placin
                them side by side. </li>
            <li><mark>widt:33.33%</mark> sets he width to 33.33% for each column, which ensures that they each take up
                one-third of the container's width, creating equal-width columns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As a result, we achive a multi-column layout composed of three equally sized columns aligned horizontally.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a multi-column layout with varying widths</h3>
        <p>
            Now, let's explore an example of how to you can use CSS floats to construct a multi-column layout with
            varying widths
        </p>
        <p>
            In our HTML structure, we define a container and specify the width for each column inside it. In our CSS
            layout, we float the columns using the <mark>.column</mark> class and the <mark>float:left</mark> rule to
            arrange them horizontally.
        </p>
        <p>
            we set the column widths with the <mark>large</mark>, <mark>medium</mark>,and <mark>small</mark> classes,
            each with different width percentages. We add padding for spacing and improved readability.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="column large">Large Column</div>
            <div class="column medium">Medium Column</div>
            <div class="column small">Small Column</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The collapsing parent problem</h3>
        <p>
            After applying the <mark>float</mark> property to elements, these elements are taken out of the normal
            document flow. This means that they don't affect the layout of subsequent elements the usual way.
        </p>
        <h3>Clearing floats with the clearfix technique</h3>
        <p>
            After using floated columns, It's important to clear the floats to maintain the normal flow for subsequent
            elements.</p>
        <p>
            in the previous section you learned about the <mark>clear</mark> property which we used <strong>directly on
                a specific element</strong> to prevent it from being adjacent to floated elements on either or both
            sides. This time, we'll use the <q>clearfix</q>, which will be applied to a parent container of floated
            elements. We will use it to clear the floats of its children so that the parent container doesn't collapse
            and correctly contains the floated elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clearfix works by <strong>adding a pseudo-element, such as <mark>::after</mark>, to the parent
                container</strong>. This pseudo-element is styled in a way that it clears the float, thus making the
            container recognize the heightof its floated children.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our code:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We use the <mark>::after</mark> pseudo-element, which is a special type of selector in CSS, that allows
                us to insert content after the content of an element. In the case of clearfix, we use it to insert an
                invisible "element" at the end of the container.</li>
            <li>the <mark>content:"";</mark> rule, which is essential for the pseudo-element to work, generates content,
                but we keep it empty</li>
            <li>the <mark>display:table;</mark> rule changes the display type, which helps in the clearing process.</li>
            <li>the <mark>clear:both;</mark> rule clears the float from both the left and right sides. This action
                forces the container to expand and encompass the floated elements, thus solving the collapsing issue.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why and when to use clearfix</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>to ensure that a parent container fully wraps around its floated children</li>
            <li>to maintain the intented layout, particularly when subsequent content follows the floated elements.</li>
            <li>as a cleaner solution compared to adding extra non-semantic markup (like empty <mark>div</mark>
                elements) to clear floats</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Clear vs Clearfix</h3>
        <p>In general</p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>clear</mark> is about managing the layout flow of individual elements in relation to floated
                items.</li>
            <li><q>clearfix</q> is a broader technique to ensure that a container property its floated children, thus
                maintaining the integrity of the overall layout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In other words, use <mark>clear</mark> to fine-tune specific elements, and use the <q>clearfix</q> technique
            to address the layout behavior of an entire container
        </p>
        <h3>The overflow method</h3>
        <p>
            Before we move on, we want to show you one more method to clear floats besides the traditional
            <mark>clear</mark> and the <q>clearfix</q> technique - the <mark>overflow</mark> property.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the <mark>overflow</mark> property on the parent container. This is a simpler method but can
            have unintended effects if your content is meant to extend outside the container.
