    <h1>Introduction to media queries</h1>
    <h2>Media query syntax.</h2>
    <pre>@media screen and (max-width: 600px){
    /* CSS rules for screens smaller than or equal to 600px */  
}</pre>
    <p>Let's analyze the elements of the syntax:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><mark>&commat;media</mark> - the key term that starts a media query it tells the browser to apply the
            following CSS rules only under certain conditions (which you'll need to define next).</li>
        <li><mark>screen</mark> - the media type. It specifies the type of device you're targeting. While
            <mark>screen</mark> is the most common media type for web designs, targeting computers screens, tablets and
            smartphones, there are other types too, like <mark>print</mark> (for printes) and <mark>all</mark> (for all
            media types).
        </li>
        <li><mark>and</mark> - a logical operator used to combine multiple media features. In this case, It's combining
            the media type <mark>screen</mark> with a feature query <mark>(max-width:600px)</mark> </li>
        <li><mark>(max-width:600px)</mark> - the media feature and value. It specifies the condition that needs to be
            met for the CSS rules to apply. Here, <mark>(max-width:600px)</mark> means that the enclosed CSS rules will
            only applied to screens that are 600 pixels wide or narrower. In general, <mark>max-width</mark> is a
            feature that refers to the maximum width of the display area, such as a browser window.</li>
        <li><mark>Enclosed CSS Rules</mark> - inside the curly braces <mark>{...}</mark> you place your CSS rules. These
            rules will be applied only when the media query condition is true (in this case, when screen width is less
            than or equal to 600 pixels).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Single Column Layout on Mobile</h2>
    <p>We'll start with a basic two-column layout that stacks into a single column on smaller screens.</p>
    <p>Here's how you can achieve it:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="column">Column 1</div>
        <div class="column">Column 2</div>
    </div>
    <p>Let's analyze the code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic two-column layout</strong> - each <mark>.column</mark> takes up 50% of the
            <mark>.container</mark>'s width, creating a side-by-side layout.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Media Query for Mobile</strong> - the <mark>@media</mark> rule targets screens smaller than or equal
            to 600px.</li>
        <li><strong>changing to simple column</strong> - inside the media query, <mark>.column</mark>'s width is changed
            to 100%, and <mark>float</mark> is set to <mark>none</mark>. This stacks the columns vertically on smaller
            screens.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Adjusting column layout for tablet and mobile</h2>
    <p>Now, let's create a layout that adjust from three columns to two on tablets and to one on mobile phones.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="column">Column 1</div>
        <div class="column">Column 2</div>
        <div class="column">Column 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
