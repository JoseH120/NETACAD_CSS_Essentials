    <p>Let's list them and discuss their main characteristics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fixed Layout:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>has a set width (usually measured in pixels) and does nto change size based on the browser window.</li>
            <li>is best suited for desings where precise control over width and spacing is required.</li>
            <li>can be come less user-friendly on devices with screen sizes different from the one the website was
                designed for.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Liquid or fluid layout</li>
        <ul>
            <li>uses percentages instead of fixed pixel values for widths.</li>
            <li>stretches and contracts with the browser window, filling the available space.</li>
            <li>is more adaptable than fixed layouts, but can sometimes lead to uneven or stretched content if not
                managed carefully</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Elastic layout</li>
        <ul>
            <li>combines fixed and fluid layouts using relative units like ems for widths.</li>
            <li>scales depending on the user's font size settings, making the layout accessible but also pontetially
                unpredictable in terms of its structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Flexible layout</li>
        <ul>
            <li>a mix of fluid and elastic but with more control.</li>
            <li>often incorporates media queries to change styles based on different device characteristics, leading to
                a responsive desing. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Responsive design</li>
        <ul>
            <li>an advanced form of flexible layout</li>
            <li>uses CSS media queries to adapt the layout to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring optimal
                viewing experience on any device.</li>
            <li>often involves flexible grids, scalable images, and sometimes different content for different devices.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Adaptive desing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>similar to responsive design - uses distinct layouts for different screen sizes.</li>
            <li>instead of one fluid layout, it often has several fixed layouts designed for specific screen sizes.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
