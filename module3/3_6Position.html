            <p>is an essential concept that empowers you to <strong>manage the arrangement of elements</strong> on a web

                <h2>Static positioning.</h2>
                <p>static is <strong>the default positioning behavior</strong> for HTML element in CSS</p>
                <p>When an element is set to <mark>static positioning</mark>,it is displayed in the normal flow of the
                    document, following the order in which it appears in the HTML code.</p>
                <p>it is not affected by the <mark>top</mark>, <mark>right</mark>, <mark>bottom</mark>, or
                    <mark>left</mark>
                    properties, which means it remains exactly whre it would be placed in the document without any CSS
                    positioning applied.
                </p>
                <p>In simpler terms, elements with static positioning are laid out on the web page as if you didn't
                    apply
                    special positioning rules to them.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Absolute positioning.</h2>
                <p>Absolute positioning allows you to strong{place an element at a specific position relative to its
                    closest
                    positioned ancestor (an element that is not set to <mark>position: static</mark>) If there is no
                    positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the
                    viewport)</p>
                <p>For example</p>
                <div class="container1">
                    <div class="absolute-box">Absolute positioning</div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
                <p>Allows you to <strong>adjust the position of an element relative to its normal position in the
                        document
                        flow</strong>. It doesn'take the element out of the normal document flow, which means it will
                    still
                    occupy space in its original position.</p>

                <div class="container2">
                    <div class="relative-box">
                        relative positioning
                    </div>
                </div>

            <section>
                <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
                <p>Fixed positioning allows you to <strong>fix an element's position relative to the viewport</strong>,
                    meaning it will stay in the same position even when the page is scrolled. This is often used for
                    elements like navigation bars or "back to top" buttons that need to remain visible as the user
                    scrolls.
                </p>

                <h2>Sticky Positioning</h2>
                <p>Sticke positioning allows <strong>an element to stick to the user's screen as they scroll</strong>.
                    It
                    behaves like a hybrid between <mark>relative</mark> and <mark>fixed</mark> positioning</p>
                <p>The element is treated as relative until it reaches a certain point during scrolling , at which it
                    becomes
                    <mark>fixed</mark>
                </p>
                <p>This is particularly useful for elements like headers or navigation bars that you want to keep
                    visible as the user scrolls through a page.</p>
                <p>as you scroll dow the page, the sub-header will 'stick' to the top of the viewport.</p>
                <p>The <mark>top:0</mark> value is crucial as it defines the threshold at which the sticky behavior
                    triggers.</p>
